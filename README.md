# knn-naive_bayes

This is a repository of two different projects implementing two different classifiers

# Project One

## Titanic Survival Prediction

RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK, to New York City.

Create a model that predicts survival rates on the Titanic based on certain features

Metric for success:

A model with an accuracy level greater than 85% using K Nearest Neighbours

# Project Two

## Email Spam Prediction

Email spam, also referred to as junk email or simply spam, is unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email. Spam is ubiquitous, unavoidable, and repetitive. Spam emails often have malicious intent and therefore you should be aware of the potential risks

Research Question:

Create a model that classifies whether an email is spam or not

Metric for success: A model with an accuracy level greater than 85% using Naive Bayes
